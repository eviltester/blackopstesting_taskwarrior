Exploratory testing notes for the Black Ops Testing Webinar for TaskWarrior on 22nd September 2014

* http://blackopstesting.com

For this Webinar we were testing TaskWarrior

* http://taskwarrior.org

You will see:

* My notes, which I made in Google Docs, in the pdf in the root
* extracts from taskwarrior in the data directory
* screenshots of the working environment in images
* earlyMacTesting has a dump of early testing that I was going to investigate
* the main log files of the session as history dumps or other in the txt files

This should act as a supplement when you watch the webinar, and hopefully as a standalone example of some exploratory testing and learning documentation approaches.
